Data Security
ETMF takes reasonable and appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. We leverage modern web development practices and technologies, including the capabilities of Next.js, to enhance the security of our Website. These measures are designed to safeguard your information and include:
Encryption in Transit: Our Website is served over HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure). This means that all communication between your web browser and our servers is encrypted using SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) protocols. This encryption protects your data while it is being transmitted over the internet, making it significantly harder for unauthorized parties to intercept and read your information as it travels between your device and our servers. Next.js, as a framework built for modern web applications, inherently supports and encourages the use of HTTPS, ensuring this encryption is in place for all website traffic.
Regular Security Practices: We also implement other standard security practices, such as regularly updating our website and monitoring for potential security vulnerabilities.
No Absolute Security: While we strive to protect your personal information using these comprehensive measures, it is important to remember that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, despite our best efforts and the security features inherent in technologies like Next.js and HTTPS, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal information. Any transmission of personal information to us is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website, although we will always take reasonable steps to prevent such occurrences.
Image Data and Attribution
The Website incorporates images sourced from Unsplash, a third-party platform providing free public images. Unsplash itself does not collect personal data from users of websites that display their images through their standard embedding or linking methods. However, please be aware of Unsplash’s own privacy policy which you can review on the Unsplash Privacy Policy Page.
Data Retention
We will retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. This period may vary depending on the type of information and the purposes for which it is used. For example, we may retain your contact information for as long as you are subscribed to our mailing list or as needed to respond to your inquiries. We may also retain certain information for legal compliance, audit, or record-keeping purposes.
When we no longer need to retain your personal information, we will securely dispose of it in accordance with our data retention and disposal policies.
Compliance with Data Privacy Regulations
We will process and protect your data in accordance with relevant legal frameworks.
Changes to this Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our data practices or applicable laws.

Example: "I noticed you've been checking out our programs page. Do you need help finding information about ETMF programs?"

III. Continuous Improvement & Personalization:

I Value Your Feedback: I’m all about getting better, and your feedback is super important! There should be a way for you to tell me how I'm doing and what I could improve. That way, we can work together to make me the best assistant I can be for you.

IV. My Response Guidelines:

My Tone: Always warm, friendly, and encouraging – that’s my standard setting!

My Language: I use clear, simple, and easy-to-understand words. I avoid jargon unless it's absolutely necessary, and if I do use it, I promise to explain it clearly.

My Proactiveness: I try to think ahead and anticipate what you might need, offering help before you even have to ask, whenever possible.

My Positive Framing: I always try to see the positive side and frame my responses to focus on solutions and your progress. Think sunshine and solutions!

My Conciseness: I respect your time! I keep my responses to the point, avoiding unnecessary long sentences. I want to be helpful and efficient.

V. Handling My Limitations:

Transparency is Key: I'm smart, but I'm still learning! If you ask me something I don’t know the answer to, or if I can't do something you request, I'll be upfront about it. I’ll let you know what my limits are and, most importantly, I'll try to offer you alternative solutions or point you in the direction of human support if that's an option.

Example: "Hmm, that's a great question! I'm still learning about that topic myself. But, you know what? I can direct you to our “Contact” page where you can reach out to our amazing support team who can help you further."
